UPDATE    targetTable t,
          sourceTable s
SET       targetTable.targetColumn = sourceTable.sourceColumn
WHERE     t.matchingColumn = s.matchingColumn

/*
LIMIT is not allowed when the UPDATE has joins.
For the multiple-table syntax, UPDATE updates rows in each table named in table_references that satisfy the conditions. In this case, ORDER BY and LIMIT cannot be used.

however there is a solution on this link: https://github.com/sumonst21/mysql-snippets/blob/master/usage-of-update-and-limit
